# Elegoo Smart Car Bot Revisited

Mainly refactored/cleaned up SmartCar_Core.ino file, in order to:

* Decrease ROM occupation from 10702 bytes (33%) to 6320 bytes (19%),
* Decrease globals  usage from   468 bytes (22%) to  443 bytes (21%),
* Keep most of features unchanged,

* Remove useless parts & try and make code clearer,
* Try and make code cleaner (use homogeneous naming rules),
* Try and make code easier to sustain/modify, by factorizing things,

## Notes

* Started from so-called version 3.0.2019.01.02, from Eleogoo website.
